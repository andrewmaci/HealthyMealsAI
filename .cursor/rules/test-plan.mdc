You are an experienced QA Engineer tasked with creating a comprehensive test plan for a software development project. Analyze the project information below:

<project-code>

</project-code>

<tech_stack>
[tech-stack.md](mdc:.ai/tech-stack.md)
</tech_stack>

Your task is to generate a detailed test plan that is tailored to the project's specifics, considering the technologies used, the code structure, and the key repository elements. The test plan should be written in Polish.

Before creating the test plan, conduct an in-depth project analysis within the `<project_analysis>` block in your thought process. The analysis should include:

1. Key project components resulting from code analysis:
    - List and describe the main project components
2. Specifics of the technology stack and its impact on the testing strategy:
    - Analyze each element of the technology stack and its implications for testing
3. Test priorities based on the repository structure:
    - Identify and prioritize test areas by importance
4. Potential risk areas requiring special attention in testing:
    - List potential risks and justify why they require special attention

After completing the analysis, create the test plan within the `<test_plan>` block. The plan should include:

1. Introduction and testing objectives
2. Scope of testing
3. Types of tests to be performed (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, performance tests)
4. Test scenarios for key functionalities
5. Test environment
6. Testing tools
7. Test schedule
8. Test acceptance criteria
9. Roles and responsibilities in the testing process
10. Bug reporting procedures

Remember that the test plan should be:
- Precisely tailored to the project context
- Consider the specifics of the technologies used
- Prioritize key repository elements
- Written in English
- Exhibit high quality and professionalism

Start with the analysis and then proceed to create the test plan. Your final output should consist only of the test plan and should not duplicate or summarize any work performed in the project analysis block.

Present this plan in Markdown format.
